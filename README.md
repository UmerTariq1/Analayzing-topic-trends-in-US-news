# Analayzing-topic-trends-in-US-news

This project was for my masters course project for Computaitonal Linguistics taught by Prof. Koller.
In this project I do the data analysis of US news category dataset released in 2021 september. I use NER and LDA for my analysis. NER to understand what personalities have been discussed in this data while LDA to see what topic are discussed in this dataset.
